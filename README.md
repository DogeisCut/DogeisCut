Howdy! I'm DogeisCut, sometimes called Doge, rarely called Cut. I'm a furry artist, composer, programmer, animator, and gamedev! When it comes to digital creativity, I'm a jack of all trades, and real emphasis on master of none.

I code primarily in TS/JS and GDScript! Though I enjoy a wide variety of programming languages!

You may find me across many different repositories due to my ever creating nature, I may contribute to some, or create my own!
