# About Me
Howdy! I'm DogeisCut, sometimes called Doge, rarely called Cut. I'm a 19 year old furry artist, composer, programmer, animator, and gamedev who goes by he/they! When it comes to digital creativity, I'm a jack of all trades, and real emphasis on master of none. As I like to put it elsewhere, "uhh sometimes i do a little bit of everything all of the time and forget to post it"

I code primarily in TS/JS and GDScript! Though I enjoy a wide variety of programming languages! Not everything I make is available in a publy repository unfortunetly!

You may find me across many different repositories due to my ever creating nature, I may contribute to some, or create my own!
